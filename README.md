# Instructions
- To deploy the website: https://franklant.github.io/gogradients/
- Enter a color into the two input fields
- Press the 'apply color' to create a mixed-gradient with the two colors
- Change how the gradient is displayed using the two 'axis gradient fill' options.

# What I Learned:
- CSS manipulation through JavaScript
- Using setInterval() to constantly update the screen every frame
